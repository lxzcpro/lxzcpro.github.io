  abstract={Biological tissues are composed of distinct microenvironments that spatially orchestrate gene expression and cell identity. However, the regulatory principles governing domain-specific cellular functions remain poorly understood due to the lack of effective methods for mapping gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in situ. To address this gap, we introduce STARNet, a representation learning approach that leverages heterogeneous hypergraph modeling of spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic data to resolve tissue-domain-specific regulatory interactions. By integrating graph neural networks with contrastive learning in a self-supervised framework, STARNet learns unified embeddings that preserve both multi-modal molecular features and anatomical spatial context, enabling accurate and domain-resolved GRN reconstruction within complex tissues. Benchmarking on both simulated and real datasets demonstrates that STARNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate its broad applicability across diverse biological contexts, including neural development, genetic disease risk, and drug-induced developmental toxicity. In the mouse brain, it delineates region-specific regulatory networks and reconstructs spatiotemporal programs underlying neural stem cell differentiation. In human genetics, it provides a mechanistic link between genotypes and phenotypes by showing how genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for complex diseases perturb hippocampus-specific GRNs. In developmental toxicology, STARNet reveals that drug-induced disruptions of GRNs in defined embryonic regions underlie tissue-specific vulnerability. Collectively, STARNet offers a powerful and versatile framework for resolving the spatial regulatory logic of complex tissues, providing multi-angle insights into tissue patterning, development, and disease mechanisms.},
