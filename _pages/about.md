Hi! I am Xuting Zhang, a third-year undergraduate at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jianyang Zeng](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jianyang-zeng.html). In Fall 2025, I visited [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) as an exchange student, where I was fortunate to conduct research on **virtual drug screening** under the supervision of Prof. [Rohit Singh](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/rohit-singh). Previously, during my freshman year, I worked with Prof. [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/) on **computational protein modeling**, and with Prof. [Yanxiao Zhang](https://zhangyxlab.github.io/index.html) on aging research through the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from mice.

My research interests lie at the **intersection of machine learning and life sciences (AI4Science)**. I primarily focus on developing novel computational methods for biological discovery, including the construction of multi-omics models and computational protein engineering for applications in protein interaction and design. Additionally, I am passionate about developing new algorithms for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics and leveraging them for clinical data analysis.
