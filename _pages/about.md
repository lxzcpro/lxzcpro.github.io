Hi! I am Xuting Zhang, a sophomore in Westlake University, advised by Prof. Jianyang Zeng. Previously, in my freshmen year, I was lucky to work under the supervision of Prof. Fajie Yuan for developing large-scale protein language models and Prof. Yanxiao Zhang for aging by analyzing single cell data of mice.

I mainly focus on the intersection of machine learning and biology in a broad scope. My research interest includes developing multi-omics single cell models, protein language models, and utiliziing them on downstream tasks such as protein-protein interactions, and de novo design proteins.

Research Interests:
- Machine Learning Method for Single Cell Analysis
- Large Language Model for Life Sciences
- De Novo Design Protein
