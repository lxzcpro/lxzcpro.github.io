<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Xuting Zhang, a sophomore at Westlake University, advised by Prof. [Jianyang Zeng](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jianyang-zeng.html). Previously, in my freshmen year, I was lucky to work under the supervision of Prof. [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/) for developing large-scale protein language models and Prof. [Yanxiao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YA5MtwsAAAAJ) for aging research by analyzing single cell RNA-seq data of mice.

I mainly focus on the intersection of machine learning and biology in a broad scope. My research focuses on machine learning for biology, particularly developing multi-omics models, protein language models, and applications in protein interactions and design.

Research Interests:
- Single-cell Omics Integration and Machine Learning
- Protein Language Modeling
- Computational Protein Design and Structure Prediction
