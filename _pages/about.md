Hi! I am Xuting Zhang, a third-year undergraduate at Westlake University, advised by Prof. [Jianyang Zeng](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jianyang-zeng.html). I am also fortunate to conduct research on drug discovery at Duke University under the supervision of Prof. [Rohit Singh](https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/rohit-singh). Previously, during my freshman year, I had the valuable opportunity to work with Prof. [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/) on developing large-scale protein language models, and with Prof. [Yanxiao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YA5MtwsAAAAJ) on aging research through the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from mice.

My research interests lie at the **intersection of machine learning and life sciences (AI4Science)**. I primarily focus on developing novel computational methods for biological discovery, including the construction of multi-omics models and protein language models for applications in protein interaction and design. Additionally, I am passionate about developing new algorithms for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics and leveraging them for clinical data analysis.
